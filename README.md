# Disable-And-Move-Offline-Computers

This PowerShell script reads a list of computer names from a text file and automates the process of disabling their Active Directory accounts. It searches for each computer in a specified source OU, and if found, disables the account and moves it to a designated destination OU. This helps maintain a clean and organized AD environment by separating inactive computers from active ones.
